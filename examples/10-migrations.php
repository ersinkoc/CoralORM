// For this example, we'll simulate how it might be triggered programmatically.

// Assume MigrationManager discovers migration files from a configured directory.
// It would then execute their `up()` methods in sequence.

// We need a mock/conceptual MigrationManager for this example.

echo "-------------------\n";
echo "Migration examples complete.\n";
echo "These examples are highly conceptual and depend on the ORM's specific migration system.\n";
echo "Actual migrations involve CLI tools, version tracking in the database, and robust schema manipulation capabilities.\n";
echo "The `MigrationManager` and `MigrationInterface` are assumed components of such a system.\n";
